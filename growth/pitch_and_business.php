Or you're formally presenting to a senior leader or hoping to grab a few minutes with venture capitalists at a conference. In all these situations, you need an elevator pitch.

							<p class="sub_heading">The concept may not be new, but it's still sound: By reducing your message to its very essence, you can ensure that your recipients will not only understand what you have to say but will also buy into your idea.

										In its simplest form, a Feasibility Study represents a definition of a problem or opportunity to be studied, an analysis of the current mode of operation, a definition of requirements, and evaluation of alternatives, and an agreed-upon course of action. As such, the activities for preparing a Feasibility Study are generic in nature and can be applied to any type of project, be it for systems and software development, making an acquisition, or any other project.
